> "stay hungry,stay foolish"

hello, everyone. Welcome to my blogs, I'am neo, a PHD candidate in Shanghai.

Althought I am a small gear in this huge world, l want to have my own sky. my own family and my sweet wife and a branch of children

l always listen to JAY 's  music. and l am crazy about traveling

Nice to meet you here. üòÄüò•‚ù§
